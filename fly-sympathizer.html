<p>I did not feel for the fly. What it went through, who it was, its motivation, purpose, life. At first I did not think to, so didn’t. Then, because I didn’t, I wanted to. So I tried, found I couldn’t.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was hard. In lieu of beginning to understand and feel for the fly, with the fly, I met resistance, a great and tremendous and tidal resistance, like trying to connect two magnets of the same charge and failing because there’s this invisible force, stubborn and powerful and opposingly pushy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Incapable of cooperating, the germy cretin does not deserve to be sympathized with. This has everything to do with it being a bug that <em>bugs</em>. The black puke is spit from oblivion and only invades and infiltrates, leaving streams of falling flyspecks in its wake on way to our kitchens, our picnics, our homes. And it is purposeless, senseless, reasonless, a flake of filth who visits expressly to annoy perturb pester disturb. A disturbance in daylight. A disturbance in a pool of calm even if our calm is the American kind: chaotic and frenzied and busy, modern. The fly comets in, shatters even this peace. We shoo and it returns, pulled by human gravity, to an uncalculated orbit about us, ignorant and perpetually guilty of a constant crime we cannot punish it for. The fly that visits, the one startling you with a near-ear buzz, the one drawing attention to the itchy speck on your skin, the one hopping just a little closer to your fork, is dirty, a spore of the outdoors, in, and you never know just how dirty. This makes it worse. Despite not knowing, by default, you imagine that it hatched in a squirming pile of white atop some alley-side heap of decay and spends its pathetic life single mindedly sniffing out its next fix of rotting neighborhood gruel: swirls of glistening dog shit, colorful insides of an unlucky squirrel spilt and baking roadside, the brothy ooze slicked on the bottom of the dumpsters behind the local Chinese joint, beached diapers, used condoms, and feminine products all in various stages of wear. Up against this, there’s no room for sympathy.</p>
<p>And flies being bits of biohazard and disturbers of the peace are the low hanging fruits of just having gone outside in the summer. There’s tons more dirt to be dug up the winged contagions after a little more thought:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flies don’t respect our boundaries. There are a number of terrible sufferings a fly brings. Possible but unlikely: death, total blindness, (all the obscure diseases with horrible symptoms.) Possible but slightly more likely: Definitely: annoyance, disgust</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Intrusion Smear Gore Decay Innards Gruel Breeding ground Mucking in, on mucilaginous afterbirth. Evade Broth as in I suspect every fly of having been raised very near a watering hole of mucilaginous intestinal broth, nature’s cesspool of contagions, whose surface is acned with large green bubbles that throw omnidirectional slime upon popping.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their experience is so unlike mine I can’t begin to imagine. Don’t want to because: They are annoying pests [not worth my time] aka useless. they are completely valueless to us, unlike, say, the spider which, though being a little terrifying and gross itself, actually rounds up pesty insects that annoy us anyway — like the fly — or say, the dragonfly which eats moths and the like. But the fly? We value only its removal They are disgusting aka dangerous. Fly facts that float around the collective public conscious like: they poo every time they land, vomit up this acid to dissolve their soon-to-be food into a slurpable soup.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ethicists index the moral permissibility of killing animals, be it pigs, cows, chickens, dolphins, you name it, flies, off of whether they can experience suffering. We are the index to benchmark the animal kingdom against. How similar is Exhibit A to Us? across all sorts of dimensions: intelligence, emotional capacity, sociability, language use, and on and on. This isn’t a controversial practice; how else would we go about understanding the physical world? But this makes it hard to think about or relate to animals that extend further and further out toward the fringes of “other”. I have no idea how you do that.]</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Relatability through Anthropomorphism.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The nasties go here.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This makes it hard to even want to sympathize with Musca domestica, let alone put in the work of hunting for sufficient precedent to. It’s hard to sympathize with the fly.</p>
